## Novel Gaussian Dispersion Model for urban climate studies

The aim of this model was to determine the gaseous pollutant concentrations resulting from the natural gas-powered central heating at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki main campus, on the basis of limited emission and meteorological data. For this reason, a methodology was compiled addressing emissions and concentration levels as a function of a set of meteorological scenarios: Emissions were estimated based on campus operational conditions and concentration levels were calculated by employing the Gaussian plume model approach via an in-house implementation in Python. The necessary climatic conditions were used to compile a total of 1080 different weather â€“ dispersion model scenarios. The obtained results allowed the adequate analysis of the geospatial distribution of pollutants and the creation of pollutant concentration heatmaps using Folium library.
